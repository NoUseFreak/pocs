# POCs

This repo contains random Proof of Concepts (POCs) that I've created over the years. Some of them are just for fun, others are more serious.

These different mini-projects are not meant to be used in production, but rather to be used as a starting point for a real project. They are not meant to be perfect, but rather to be a starting point for a real project.

## Motivation

I've created this repo to share my POCs with the world. I hope that they will be useful to someone.
It takes a lot of time to get to know a new technology.

## Contributing

Although this is not the main goal of this repo, I'm open to contributions. Feel free to open a PR if you want to add something.
